### What exactly is Shift?
Shift is web framework build around idea of progressive, domain driven API development.
This approach is designed to help developers start their project without worry about
it's future complexity and scalability. This effect is achieved by adapting and favouring
domain based architecture supported by strong code separation between particular domains. 

In result, Shift promotes 3-stage project life cycle:
1. setup
2. expand
3. divide
